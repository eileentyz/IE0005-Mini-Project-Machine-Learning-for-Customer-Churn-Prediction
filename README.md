## Project-Overview
Customer churn refers to the phenomenon where customers stop using a company's product or service. Predicting churn allows businesses to take proactive measures to retain valuable customers. In this project, we apply machine learning techniques to predict whether a customer will churn based on their profile and service usage.

## Machine Learning Approach
We explored and compared several models:

- Logistic Regression  
- Random Forest  
- XGBoost  
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

**Evaluation Metrics:**

- Accuracy  
- Precision  
- Recall  
- F1-Score  
- ROC-AUC Score
