# IE0005-Mini-Project-Machine-Learning-for-Customer-Churn-Prediction
---
## Project Overview
Customer churn refers to the phenomenon where customers stop using a company's product or service. Predicting churn allows businesses to take proactive measures to retain valuable customers. In this project, we apply machine learning techniques to predict whether a customer will churn based on their profile and service usage.
